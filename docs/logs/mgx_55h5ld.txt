1. 🎨 Color Palette – Warmer & More Human
Currently, the color scheme feels quite cold and minimal – especially noticeable on the Contact page.

Please update the overall color palette to match the warmer and more editorial vibe of my original site:
🔗 https://maisonadrian.com

That site captures the brand tone I’m aiming for: calm, refined, and human – not sterile. You're welcome to pull the background tones, accent colors, and typography styles from there.

2. ✉️ Email Address – Correction
The email address on the new site needs to be corrected.
Please replace all instances of the current one with:

maisonadrian@gmx.de

This should apply to contact forms, footers, and any “Let’s work together” CTAs.

3. 🖼️ Images – Use Realistic AI-Generated Visuals (No Personal Images)
I don’t currently have personal images or brand photos to include.
That said, you're welcome to use realistic AI-generated images throughout the site as placeholders – as long as they look clean, professional, and believable.

Please avoid using overly “stock photo” or artificial-looking visuals – the goal is to keep it minimal, editorial, and brand-appropriate. Clean backdrops, muted tones, and a bit of mood would work well here. 

And remove tge Portfolio enterely ; Recipient: False
Thought: This is a detailed web development task with specific requirements for color scheme updates, email address changes, and image modifications. The request includes clear design references and specific content changes, making it actionable as a development task.

I've updated all pages (About, Services, Contact) with the warm color scheme and correct typography. Currently reviewing for consistency. Would you like me to continue checking other components?

2025-04-19 08:38:04.569 | INFO     | metagpt.environment.mgx.mgx_env:publish_message:35 - User Requirement: 🧾 Testimonial Section – Layout Guidelines
Use a full-width, minimalist layout with plenty of breathing room and white space

Display one testimonial at a time, centered on the page

Implement a gentle auto-rotating slider, where each quote fades or slides into the next every few seconds (no arrows or manual controls needed – it should feel smooth and editorial)

Each testimonial should follow this structure:

Client quote – displayed in a large, serif typeface (similar to Playfair Display or anything clean and elegant)

Client name and role – positioned directly underneath in smaller sans-serif font (light weight, minimalist)

➡️ Please include a total of 5–8 testimonials in the slider. Since I only have a few real client quotes at the moment, you’re free to invent the remaining ones – as long as they sound realistic and are consistent with the brand tone. Use fictional brand names, founders, and creative leads if needed – just keep the tone professional, premium, and grounded.

🎨 Visual & Tone Direction
Background color: a soft warm beige/off-white (like on maisonadrian.com)

Text color: charcoal or soft black for high readability and sophistication

Typography should be warm, human, and refined – no hard edges or overly modern styles

This section should feel premium, calm, and trust-building – like a high-end magazine excerpt.

You can refer to the current testimonial section on my live site for tone and styling reference:
🔗 https://maisonadrian.com; Recipient: False
Thought: This request involves specific design implementation for a testimonials section, including layout, styling, animations, and content creation. It has clear requirements for the testimonial structure, visual design, and typography, making it a development task.
